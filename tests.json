Multiplying AB to the left gives (AB) cos 55 = 3.  Dividing by cos (55) gives  AB = 3/cos(55). Using a calculator gives us  AB = 5.23 Since AB = BC, we know that AB + BC = 10.46 .

Choice A (\"therefore\"), choice D (\"as a result\") and choice E (\"and\") do not present contrasting conjunctions. In this sentence \"but\" is not your best option for a conjunction. A semi-colon is used, so the three simple conjunctions (and/but/yet/etc.) are not as appropriate as the complex conjunctions (therefore/however/nevertheless/etc.). If just a comma was used, then \"but\" would have been appropriate (i.e. \"...into the way of danger physically, but professionals such as doctors...\").
